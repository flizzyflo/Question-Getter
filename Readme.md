## Webscraping Questions, Answers and Images to improve my university grade

This is a webscraping tool used to scrape questions as well as their answers and belonging images. I programmed it to 
facilitate generating learning cards for a specific university course. This programm scrapes all the questions
and answers from an online self assesement webpage from the university.
Questions and answers are matched via an unique question code. All three information are stored into a 
csv file, which can be imported into anki card learning tool. 
Images are named corresponding to to the unique question identifier to be added to the anki questions
manually later on. 

### What am I using within this project?
I am using several things within this project:
<br>-requests to get the html page
<br>-Beautifulsoup to seach the html content
<br>-Path and os for storing data
<br>-csv for creating a import-csv file
<br>-pandas for checking duplicates in csv files
